Crypto talk gets full of jargon-y geek-speak pretty fast. But it's simpler than it seems. Let’s slow down the Nerd Express and start with the basics. Ethereum is the engine behind most of the cool stuff you see on the Base chain and throughout and much of the crypto world. 

Once you understand how Ethereum works, it's like seeing the world below from an airplane. Instantly, it all fits together, and all this crypto stuff — even beyond Ethereum — makes more sense. 

 Let's learn what Ethereum is and what made it the greatest crypto innovation since Satoshi pressed the GO button on Bitcoin. The gecko will guide you.

## **Quick takeaways**

- Ethereum works like a worldwide, shared computer that anyone can access with a crypto wallet. That's right. No grouchy banks. No gatekeepers. No sneaky peekers at the ATM. It's free, as in freedom.

- Instead of using middlemen to send money to your friend who's always broke, Ethereum uses smart contracts. These small computer programs live on the blockchain and can move value from you to your broke friend without anyone else in the middle of it. Hopefully, that broke @%*&! sends the ETH back one day.

- The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is the clever bit that actually runs these programs, and it lives on EVERY full node. Any chain built with the EVM can use the same apps and tools.

- Layer 2 networks like Base help with speed and cost. They handle the busy work on their own chain, then send the results back to the main Ethereum chain for security.

- Once you get the hang of Ethereum, most of the EVM world starts to make sense, and you instantly become the most interesting gecko in any room. They'll swoon, I tell ya.

## **Ethereum in plain English**

Ethereum is a shared computer that lives on thousands of machines (validators) around the world. **Nobody owns the network** and nobody can change the rules just because theit GrubHub order was wrong and now and someone's gonna pay. 

Remember that time the bank let that charge for @%*&!-hub go through even though you swore it wasn't you? Not a problem with Ethereum. Only transactions approved by your private key get through. But if it was you... well, let's just say the blockchain never forgets.

And the blockchain is open, permissionless, as they say. Anyone -- anywhere in the world -- can send transactions, read the data, or run programs on the EVM. It just takes a bit of ETH to grease the silicon wheels. **ETH functions as the gas token** to keep the machines purring along.

In the early days, they called Ethereum a “world computer.” It's a global network of computers that all execute the same smart contracts and **must agree** on the same results.

It's not all about ETH, though. ETH is the gas token and a store of value in its own right, but the network also supports tokens. These might be fun memecoin tokens, or utility tokens that unlock features. Tokens represent ownership, but whatever they represent may or may not have value. That's up to the market to decide.

## **Smart contracts: programs that run by themselves**

Smart contracts run by themselves once deployed. Some are “set in stone” and never change. Others include admin or upgrade functions, which means the developer can update parts of the contract or control certain features. **Always check for owner permissions before trusting a token contract.** They can have some sneaky functions like blacklisting wallet addresses (so you can't transfer or sell).

Think of it like buying a candy bar from a vending machine. You feed the machine the right amount of quarters and press the button. Bingo-Bango! Now, you've got a snack. No middleman needed, and everyone gets the same result, given the same conditions. **It's determinstic.** And you don't need to ask Mom for permission, goshdarnit.

Smart contracts take the permissionless concept and apply it to finance, games, art, tokens, and everything else on the chain. Every decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, NFT marketplace, and memecoin is powered by these contracts. **They work like switches. If this happens, do that.** And they do the same thing every time the same condition trips the switch.

Base uses these EVM smart contracts, does the math and switch logic on the fly, and then passes the transactions to Ethereum in bulk. Base says to Ethereum, "Yo, big brother, this is my record of what happened. **Make sure nobody can change it.**"
