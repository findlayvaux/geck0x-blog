Geck0x is another project from the sleep-deprived, sugar-addled minds at [Lumpy Labs](https://lumpylabs.com), a crypto startup focused on EVM chains. Base, in particular. 

We build tools. We educate. We HODL. 

We started this blockchain education blog with one simple goal: make crypto easy to understand -- and safer for users. 

Let's make crypto better, fam.
